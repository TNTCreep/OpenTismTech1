Cell-File System

Cell-FS is a graphical file management system for personal computers and servers allowing ease of access for even the most braindead people right now it is currently in beta with various bugs like clicking the bottom left of the screen will crash the app and require u to kill it via CTRL-ALT-C but there is nothing to click there anyway so dw you have to misclick really badly to actually press it or be fucking around to begin with so yeah its pretty much fully functional except for copying and pasting. but its pretty cool and useful i'd say.
